# PaperDupe
This is a dupe for Paper servers running 1.20.5 through 1.21.1#35 (patched in #36). #35 was part of 1.21.1 beta, so likely no server will run it.

# How to use
Start by running `/dupehelp`, and then following the instructions run `/dupe`. If it fails, it may be patched. DM me `@h1ggsk` on Discord if you have a problem, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

# Origin
The original author is unknown, but I created this as a fork of Benefit by `@leftydupes`.

# FAQ
- Is it a virus?

No, read the source code. It is NOT a virus.

- It failed! What do I do?

DM me `@h1ggsk` on Discord. I will help you to the best of my abilities.

- I think I can improve it!

Yay! Please make a fork, and if I feel the code is effective, there is a high probability I will add it.
